# Nodejs Express API Testing Auth

Small project to practice technologies and libraries related with JWT, hash, blacklist with redis and integration among express, passport and bcrypt.

There are a lot of points in which It can be improved.

The following contents are not cool stuff to do, but I did, because I was just practing:
- The raw Datatabase queries;
- Push sensible files, such as, database, keyhash and config files;
- Other details through the code.
